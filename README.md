# Bag-of-Visual-Words
## Abstract
The aim of this project is to classify images into different categories using SIFT features and SVM, Random Forest classifiers. SIFT
(Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)algorithm detects interest points in
the image, and then describes these points using a feature vector.
These are then clustered using KMeans to create a visual vocabulary. Images are represented by histograms of visual words in them
and a classifier is then used on these histograms. The performance of
the classifier is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
